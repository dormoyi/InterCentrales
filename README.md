## To-Do list

- [x] Project images in latent space
- [x] Modify bounds of the direction
- [x] Find translations in latent space
- [x] Saving pipeline for direction
- [x] Solve bald issue
- [ ] Detect and improve bad translations
- [ ] Saving pipeline for edited images
- [ ] Solve specific issues (manually or with other methods)
- [ ] Fix artifacts (using original images)
- [ ] Improve resolution (super resolution ?)

## Quick Start

First create a new virtual environment and install all the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then download the dataset of the competition available here: [drive dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-R1863MV8CuCjmycsLy05Uc6bdkWfuOP?usp=sharing)

And unzip the content in the `data/input_images` folder.

Then you can run the script `demo.py` to start the image editing API. Don't forget to change the config at the beginning of the script if you want to use the flexible config.

```bash
python demo.py
```

Or if you are using a Nvidia GPU:

```bash
FORCE_NATIVE=1 python demo.py
```

To save the latent direction you want in the `data/` folder, you can click on the 'Save' button. **The name of the translation should follow the name convention:**

- for 'cursor' transformation (min - max): `{carac}_{'min' or 'max'}`. Example `Be_min` means cursor transformation to minimal bags under the eyes (Be_min).

- for default transformation (transformation that doesn't depend on the current value of the caracteristic): `{carac}_{new_value}`. Example: `Hc_0` means default transformation to black hair color (Hc_0)

- for specific transformation (transformation that depends on the current value of the caracteristic) that will overwrite default transformation: `{carac}_{new_value}_fr_{old_value}`. Example `A_0_fr_1` means specific transformation from intermediate age (A_1) to young age (A_0), 'fr' means 'from'.

**All required transformations must be treated for all input caracterisics to make a valid submission.**

Now, given an input image, the transformations to create caracterisitcs that are not in the initial image can automatically be got with the script `utils/translation.py`. Finally you can run the script `tools/translate.py` to generate the new images in a folder respecting the naming convention of the competition (the images are generated in `data/{latent_dir}/edited_images/`)

```bash
python tools/translate.py
```

Or if you are using a Nvidia GPU:

```bash
FORCE_NATIVE=1 tools/translate.py
```

**Of course, you can generate only a subset of images or caracteristics by removing some latent vectors or by removing keys of the dictionary containing the translations.**

If all the 72 images with all caracteristics are generated (1731 images in total), you can zip the folder containing the images and run the following script to check the submission (if all the required images are inside, with the good name, type, size...):

```bash
python tools/check_submission.py
```

## AnyCost GAN tutorial

The tutorial of AnyCostGAN is in the file `AnycostGAN tuto.md` and the tutorial notebooks are in the `notebooks` folder. The original repository is here: [AnyCosGAN](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/anycost-gan).

## Commit message

Commit messages are written in present tense (e.g. `:art: refactor training loop` instead of `:art: refactored training loop`).
They also start with one or two applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit (one kind of action per commit!).

Make many but small commits!
