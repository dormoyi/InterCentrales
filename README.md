# InterCentrales Competition 2022

Repository of Inter-Centrales 2022 AI competition.

## Commit message

Commit messages start with a Capital letter and are written in present tense (e.g. `:art: Refactor training loop` instead of `:tada: Refactored training loop`).
They also start with one or two applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit (one kind of action per commit!).

Make many but small commits!
